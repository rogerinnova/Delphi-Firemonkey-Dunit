# Delphi-Firemonkey-Dunit
Porting DUnit to multiple platforms required a FireMonkey GUI which in turn needed some FMX Component development. 

This repository provides the basic code and sample projects used. To compile a mobile DUnit testing environment see 
https://github.com/rogerinnova/Delphi-Firemonkey-Dunit/tree/master/Dunitfmx

The Powerpoints included look at ActionLists and ImageLists in the Dunit VCL Form and converting such forms to FireMonkey.

Roger likes the Green Light DUnit testing interface. In order keep this presentation when debugging his libraries in the new compiler environment he has converted the single DUnit VCL form to FMX.
